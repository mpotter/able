## What We Do

### Able accelerates AI automation.

We do that by solving three problems, to varying degrees, for our customers:

1. Most companies don't know what's possible with AI.

We walk you through what's possible and train you how to take advantage.

2. Even when companies know what's possible, they don't know where to start.

We map your workflows and baseline their costs to enable AI experimentation and continuous improvement.

3. Once companies know what to prioritize, most don't have the capacity to deliver on it.

We help you redesign your workflows, implement AI automations, drive change management, and maintain systems as tools and capabilities continue to evolve.

Our customers range from Series A startups to Fortune 500s. We're industry agnostic; we operate across a range of industries and stages because we've yet to find limitations to AI's ability to create a positive impact.

#### Most companies don't know what's possible with AI.

Able walks you through what's possible.

We can start with a simple introductory demo showing you examples of what others have done. From there, we can build a bespoke training program for you and your team at various levels and functions—from executives to software engineers—with bootcamps conducted onsite, offsite, or virtually.

#### Even when companies know what's possible, they don't know where to start.

We map your workflows and baseline their costs to enable AI experimentation and continuous improvement using our proprietary Optic platform.

As many as 95% of AI projects fail to deliver a positive ROI. The reason is rarely the technology itself; it's that AI is dropped into systems previously built for human-centric work. Instead of rushing to deploy software, we must first reimagine how people and AI systems work best together.

That's why we built Optic.

The Optic platform is an analytics tool to track, identify, and assess AI automation opportunities:

1. Map how work gets done and how it should change given the latest AI capabilities
2. Translate that understanding into a set of AI opportunities prioritized by ROI
3. Continuously measure performance and revise opportunity set

Optic is deeply integrated with your customer's data, workflows, and operations; the implementation requires embedding Able technologists into organizations to train and deploy it.

#### Once companies know what to prioritize, most don't have the capacity to deliver on it.

As opposed to traditional IT, systems integrations, or software development outsourcing, the ability to drive impact with AI spans almost every single line of business. Given the cross-functional nature, there's not the capability internal to organization nor is the work a good fit for traditional outsourcing firms whose primary focus is on IT systems. Instead, Able uses a new approach that emphasizes partnership between domain experts in many different industries in many types of job functions—from marketing and legal to healthcare and finance—and Able's embedded AI engineers.

## How We Make Money

### Professional Services

Our professional services offering is spread between:

- Platform customization; Because our platforms (initially Optic) are deeply integrated with our customer's data, workflows, and operations, there is often a significant amount of configuration, integration, training, and ongoing consulting.
- Custom AI application and system development; Our customers tap us to design and develop the opportunities that we identify.
- Retainers; the pace of evolution in AI begs for continuous improvement, tweaking, and adjustment based on the latest and greatest. We help monitor, maintain, refine, and evolve the AI systems we deploy within our customer's organizations.
- Training; we offer training bootcamps to both technical and non-technical functions within organizations, either onsite, offsite, or virtually. Trainings are built from a common repository but tailored to each organization's stage and comfort with AI adoption.

### Platform Subscriptions

We offer access to our platforms (initially Optic, eventually others), via our hosted cloud service or on customers' own infrastructure. Subscriptions include support, maintenance, upgrades, and infrastructure operations.

### Who We Are And What We Believe

We're technologists eager to shape the future of work. We don't develop or train foundational models, we're practitioners who seek to use the science to maximize the value they create.

#### Beliefs

1. Humans will write a decreasing amount of code over time.
2. Within the next 18 months, less than half of new code will be written by a human. Within the next 5 years, practically no new code will be written by a human.
3. Engineering throughput will fall further and further down the list of factors slowing software development.
4. The result will be massive change to not just the technology industry but nearly every industry, most of which have become dependent on software to be successful.
5. Effective design, translating business requirements, reviewing code, and accepting accountability will be the leading inhibitors to successful software development.
6. Current workflows and the tools that support them are entirely unsuited for this reality.
7. People and teams will need to work very differently and the tools they need to support that new way of working will need to be rebuilt from the ground up.
8. It's unclear the impact AI will have on jobs, business, or the economy; the only certainty is that it's likely to create new ones and replace existing ones. Whether that's disproportionate or not will be determined over the next decade or so and will not be in our control.
9. Able should be a place that harbors great jobs for caring people who are eager to help shape this future.
10. This future is inevitable but we believe that we can play a role in making it better for ourselves, our families, and our communities.

## Why We Do What We Do

We want to shape the future of work to be more human.

We believe human capital is better spent on creative and emotionally rewarding efforts. Instead, a lot of work that exists today is better done by computers. Over time, we want more people to have time and space to pursue enthusiasm, whatever that means for them.

We use AI to accelerate that shift.

We recognize that, in the short term, AI is likely to cause job loss, career changes, and accelerate climate change. We are party to that. But, we also don't believe the free market is best suited to address these problems nor do we think there's anything we can do to stop them. Instead, we choose to accelerate change while supporting universal basic income and increased public funding toward energy science and technology.
