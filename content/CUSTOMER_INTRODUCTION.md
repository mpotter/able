Able

Able accelerates AI automation.
Workflow-first automation with ROI accountability.

---

AI automation is not a technology problem. It’s an operating problem.

- Build a clear automation portfolio (what’s worth automating)
- Create delivery capacity (ship across functions)
- Maintain ROI accountability (measure, iterate, scale/kill)

---

AI stalls when it’s layered onto workflows built for humans.

- Without workflow redesign, AI efforts don’t pay back
- The constraint is process + ownership + measurement
- The fix: redesign the workflow, then automate, then measure

---

Proven operating impact from AI automation
Representative outcomes across Enable, Prioritize, and Deliver (illustrative)

- Cycle time ↓ [25–45%] across [approval / support / onboarding] workflows
- Cost per case ↓ [15–35%] in [support / ops] through automation + routing
- Throughput ↑ [20–60%] without adding headcount in [ops / finance] teams
- First automation shipped in [2–4] weeks; portfolio baseline in [4–6] weeks
- Automation portfolio: [20–60] opportunities ranked by ROI; [5–12] delivered in first quarter
- Error rate ↓ [30–70%] on [classification / extraction / reconciliation]

“Able turned AI from experiments into an operating program with clear ROI ownership.” — [COO, Company]

A repeatable automation loop

- Map how work gets done
- Prioritize opportunities by ROI
- Deliver workflow redesign + automation
- Measure and revise continuously
- Repeat

---

Engage where you are — we cover the full loop.

- Enable (when alignment/fluency is the constraint)
- Prioritize (when focus/ROI clarity is the constraint)
- Deliver (when execution capacity is the constraint)

Start anywhere. We connect it back to the loop.

Enable: alignment + fluency that removes decision friction

- Intro demo: what “good” looks like in practice
- Role-based training: executives → operators → engineers
- Standards: what qualifies for automation + how success is measured

Proof (illustrative) — Executive alignment + functional playbooks in 3 weeks

- Decision time: weeks → days
- Output: ranked list of [12–20] candidates
- Delivered: [3–5] pilot specs ready for build
  Proof strip: Time-to-alignment [15 business days] • Outputs [playbooks + standards + pilot specs]

---

Prioritize: portfolio visibility and ROI baselines (Optic-powered)

- Map workflows and baseline cost drivers (time, rework, latency)
- Translate workflows into a ranked opportunity portfolio
- Establish governance: review cadence, owners, scale/kill decisions

Proof (illustrative) — Automation portfolio + ROI baseline

- [34] opportunities identified; [9] prioritized for immediate build
- Expected annualized impact: $[1.2–2.8]M
- Baseline completed in [6 weeks]
  Proof strip: Portfolio [34] • Prioritized [9] • Baseline [6 weeks]

Optic is workflow intelligence for AI automation

- Process mapping — how work actually flows
- ROI tracking — what’s working, what’s not
- Opportunity assessment — what to do next

Optic integrates with your data and operations; deployed with embedded Able technologists.

Deliver: ship automations and make them stick

- Redesign workflows for human + AI execution (handoffs, exceptions, QA)
- Implement automations and surrounding systems
- Drive adoption: training, ownership, iteration cadence

Proof (illustrative) — Workflow redesigned, automation deployed, adoption achieved

- Cycle time: [5 days → 2.5 days]
- Cost per unit: ↓ [22%]
- Adoption: [80–90%] within [30] days
  Proof strip: Time-to-value [3 weeks] • Measured impact ↓[22%] cost/unit

Where automation reliably pays back (illustrative examples)

Workflow → Automation → Outcome

- Support triage → classify/route/draft/escalate → cost/case ↓ [25%]
- Finance close → reconcile/variance explain/exception handling → close time ↓ [30%]
- Sales ops → enrichment/qualification/proposal drafting → throughput ↑ [40%]
- Legal intake → intake/risk flagging/clause suggestions → cycle time ↓ [35%]
- HR onboarding → doc collection/provisioning triggers → time-to-start ↓ [20%]

---

This isn’t “IT projects.” It’s cross-functional operating change.

- AI impact spans nearly every line of business
- Traditional outsourcing is misfit for cross-functional automation
- Able pairs domain experts with embedded AI engineers

---

Built for organizations ready for operating impact

- Series A to Fortune 500; industry agnostic
- Best fit: high-volume workflows, clear unit economics, cross-functional handoffs
- Common sponsors: COO, Head of Ops, CFO, CX leader, CIO/CTO

---

Next step: pick your entry point

- Option A — Portfolio (Prioritize): Map one workflow → ranked automation portfolio + ROI baseline
- Option B — Pilot (Deliver): One workflow redesigned → one automation shipped → impact measured
- Option C — Enablement: Exec alignment + team playbooks → [3–5] pilots ready for build

Start anywhere — we connect it back to the loop and drive measurable outcomes.
